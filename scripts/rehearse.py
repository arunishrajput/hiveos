"""Rehearse the recorded demo, end to end, against deployed AWS.

`ws_smoke.py` asks "is the system correct?" — 49 checks over every path,
including ones no viewer will ever see. This asks a different and, three days
before a deadline, more urgent question: **does the sequence I am about to
record actually work, in that order, in the time I have?**

So every assertion here is something a viewer can see on screen, and every beat
is wall-clock timed. A beat that passes but takes 40 seconds fails the demo just
as surely as one that breaks, because the video has 180 seconds total.

    python scripts/rehearse.py --takes 2  # BUILD_PLAN Phase 6 task 4
    python scripts/rehearse.py --ceiling  # the budget-refusal beat instead

The beat order is BUILD_PLAN's, not PROGRESS.md's earlier run sheet, and the
difference is deliberate — see `pick a slot` below.

Close stray browser tabs first: this asserts on the member list.
