"""End-to-end WebSocket smoke test against the DEPLOYED HiveOS stack.

This is the Phase 1 and Phase 2 gate, and the regression check for every phase
after them. It talks to real AWS — nothing here is mocked. A zero exit code
means the deployed system actually behaved, not that a command succeeded.

Sections 1-6 cover the WebSocket backbone; 7-12 cover the scheduler: both
slots claimed, a third claim queued with a real position, auto-dispatch when a
slot frees, and no slot leak when a task fails. Sections 13-18 cover shared
memory, token accounting, and the enforced budget ceiling. 19 covers avatar
presence and movement; 21 covers team isolation; 22 covers workspace passphrases; 23 covers administration; 20 covers fair queueing — that dispatch order follows
who has waited longest rather than who arrived first, and that the position
shown on the board is the one actually dispatched. 24-25 cover agent-to-agent
handoff: one chain id across two desks, both legs on the one meter, a queue row
pinned to the desk it was handed to, and a hop limit no prompt can argue past.

The harness resets `tokens_used` and clears MEMORY# rows before and after, so
it is re-runnable — tasks now genuinely spend (estimated) tokens and write
facts.

    pip install websockets
    python scripts/ws_smoke.py

Resolves the wss:// URL from the CloudFormation stack output, so it never
needs a hardcoded endpoint. Requires the AWS CLI on PATH for the DynamoDB
assertions.

**Close every browser tab pointed at the deployed URL before running this.**
The CONN#-leak checks assert the table holds *no* connection rows, so a live
browser anywhere in the world counts as a leak and fails four checks that have
nothing to do with the code. If those four are the only failures, that is
almost certainly what happened.
