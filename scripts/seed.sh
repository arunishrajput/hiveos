# script can assume — an agent can be hired at any time.
#
# The two seed rows are written WITHOUT their identity fields, deliberately.
# `agents.from_row` fills those in from `STARTING_ROSTER` by slot id, which is
# the same path every workspace created before the roster became data takes.
# Writing them bare here means a seeded demo board exercises that path rather
# than hiding it — and `ws_smoke.py` asserts these come back named Ada and Iris.
