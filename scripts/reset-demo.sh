# Run this between every take. `seed.sh` owns the DynamoDB demo state and is
# called from here rather than duplicated — two definitions of "a clean board"
# would drift apart. What this adds around it is the four things that bit us
# during Phase 4 and 5 verification and are invisible until they are on camera:
#
#   1. stale CONN# rows  — a crashed tab leaves a row behind, and the member
#                          count is on screen for the whole recording
#   2. in-flight SQS     — a task from the last take lands mid-take and moves a
#                          slot nobody touched
#   3. cold Lambdas      — the first claim of a take pays ~1.5s of cold start
#   4. no verification   — seed.sh exiting 0 says the CLI worked, not that the
#                          board a browser renders is clean
#
# The final check reads the board back the way a judge's browser does: a real
# WebSocket, a real `hello`, a real `state_snapshot`.

# Defaulted here, not in seed.sh. seed.sh is the generic seeder and keeps its
# 1,000,000 production-shaped default; this is the demo-facing script, so it
# owns the demo's number — and that number tracks the cost of a task, exactly
# the way `--ceiling` does in rehearse.py. Sized wrong in either direction the
# meter stops telling the truth about the product.
#
# It was 5,000 while the agent was a stub costing ~58 tokens a task, which put
# one task at almost exactly one segment of the strip. A task costs ~800 now —
# a real model, plus the tool schemas in every prompt — so 5,000 is four or
# five tasks and then the board is spent. That was harmless while the only
# thing reading this default was a camera. It is not harmless now: the URL is
# public, judges arrive at it cold, and the second visitor finds a dead floor.
#
# 100,000 is that same calibration re-derived at the real cost — ~125 tasks of
# headroom, one task at 0.8% of a strip whose segments are ~1.5%, so the bar
# visibly moves across a short session instead of never painting at all.
#
# A recorded take still wants the small board and asks for it explicitly:
# `TOKEN_BUDGET=5000`, which is what DEMO.md's pre-flight now says. Exporting
# the default here means the operator cannot get the *live* board wrong by
# running the script bare at 2am.
