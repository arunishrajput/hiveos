"""HiveOS Agent Runner — one SQS message is one agent task on one slot.

The agent is **real**: `shared/llm.py` calls a model and reports the token
usage the provider actually counted. Amazon Bedrock is blocked account-wide on
this AWS account (three regions, both first-party and Marketplace models — see
PROGRESS.md), so inference calls out to Groq. Every other component — the
queue, the scheduler, the state, the real-time layer, the hosting — is AWS.

Everything around the model is what the product actually claims:

  - team memory is loaded before the task runs, and saved facts broadcast
  - `tokens_used` is incremented atomically and broadcast to every client
  - the budget ceiling is **enforced** — the agent is not invoked at 100%

Three invariants live here:

1. **The slot is released even when the task fails.** A leaked slot deadlocks
   the workspace, and on a recording that is indistinguishable from the
   product being broken. Hence try/finally, always.
2. **A token count is only reported as real when a provider counted it.** If
   the model call fails we still answer, from `_stub_agent`, and that result
   sets `estimated` — which is sticky on the total (`state.add_tokens`), so a
   degraded call can never be laundered into a billed-looking meter.
3. **A task holds its slot for a visible minimum.** The scheduler is the
   product; a 400 ms call would make BUSY and a queue position illegible.
