"""Slot scheduling — the OS mechanic that HiveOS actually is.

Two agent slots are the CPU cores. A claim is a conditional DynamoDB update, so
two people clicking at the same instant can never both win the same slot. If
every slot is taken the task becomes a QUEUE# row and gets a real position,
because a queue you cannot see your place in is not a queue.

Both Lambdas use this module: the Router claims on demand, the Agent Runner
releases and dispatches the next waiting task. Keeping one implementation is
what stops the two paths from drifting into different state machines.

Ordering rules that matter (ARCHITECTURE.md decision 1):
  - SQS carries tasks that are RUNNING. Waiting tasks live in DynamoDB.
  - The QUEUE# delete is the exactly-once gate. Whoever wins the delete owns
    the task, so two runners finishing together cannot dispatch it twice.
