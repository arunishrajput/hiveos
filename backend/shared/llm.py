"""The model call. One provider, one function, no SDK.

Amazon Bedrock is blocked account-wide on this AWS account — not by anything
here, and not by a fixable setting. Three regions (`us-east-1`, `us-west-2`,
`ap-south-1`), both first-party and Marketplace models, all refuse:
`INVALID_PAYMENT_INSTRUMENT` for Anthropic/AI21, and a hard zero per-day token
quota (`adjustable=False`) for Amazon's own Nova. See PROGRESS.md. Inference
therefore calls out to Groq; **every other component stays on AWS.**

That split is worth stating plainly rather than hiding: a governance layer that
only works with one vendor's models is a worse governance layer. The scheduler
does not care where a token was spent, only that it was counted.

Deliberately built on `urllib` from the standard library:

  - no new dependency, so `sam build` has nothing extra to package
  - no wheel to resolve, which matters because local Python is 3.14 and any
    compiled dependency built off-container would be the wrong platform
  - the whole client is one POST and one JSON parse

The API key lives in SSM Parameter Store as a SecureString, never in
`template.yaml`, `samconfig.toml`, an environment variable, or this repository.
It is fetched once per cold start and cached for the life of the container.
